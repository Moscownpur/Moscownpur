## 🔗 Document Relationships
- [System.md](./System.md) → Core context for all technical docs  
- [PROTOCOLS.md](./PROTOCOLS.md) ↔ [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) (API + Auth alignment)  
- [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) → Influences [TODO.md](./TODO.md) updates  
- [LLM_GUIDE.md](./LLM_GUIDE.md) → Inherits structure from [System.md](./System.md) and coding conventions from [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)  
- [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) ↔ [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for environment variables and key usage

## 🧠 LLM Integration Notes
- LLMs should **read [LLM_GUIDE.md](./LLM_GUIDE.md) first** before writing/refactoring any code.  
- Use [System.md](./System.md) + [PROTOCOLS.md](./PROTOCOLS.md) as **architectural context**.  
- Use [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) + [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for prioritization and planning context.  

---

## 🔧 Maintenance
- Review this index whenever a new `.md` file is added or renamed.  
- Mark outdated docs with `⚠️ Needs Review`.  
- Recommended review cycle: **biweekly**.
